1. XAUUSD - OCTA 27, competitors: 20, 29, 35, 36
Regarding our trading conditions
On GOLD, we maintain the target spread at 27, the PnL per lot is way above average. Volume started to pick up after
holidays, and the average VPT is increasing. Unrealized PnL is steady around 34 million.

2. EURUSD - OCTA 10, same as the lowest competitor (range 10 - 19):
Our PnL per lot in stable just above the average, same as VPT, we also see a pickup in volume
our unrealized PnL is floating around 9M. In here we are maintaining the target spreads at 10, in line with the
lowest competitors.

3. GBPUSD - OCTA 14, lowest 12, then 13, 15, 22:
For GBPUSD, the pickup in volume is smaller than for GOLD and EURUSD, the PnL is around the average, our system
indicated to increase spreads, but since we have GDP release for UK on Friday, and BOE governor speech today we
decided to leave them at 14, and the unrealized PnL stabilized around 5.5M.

4. USDJPY - OCTA 20, above the middle from 10, 11, 19, 26:
In the case of USDJPY, the upward trend in VpT stabilized, the PnL per lot remains below the average, The unrealized
floats around 2.4M. But we can see increasing volatility, and decreasing time of holding position, which should start
to work in our favor in terms of PnL, so in here we also kept the spreads unchanged.

=====

5. GBPJPY - better than competitors:
GBPJPY, the subdued volatility and an increase in the average duration of positions continues.
The VpT is below average and continues to decline, the spread decrease didn't impact the PnL negatively, actually the
opposite, but ahead of the promo we decided to increase it by 1 point from 21 to 22.

6. Nas100 (Nasdaq) - in the middle of competitors:
Nasdaq, our average realized PnL is still growing, the VpT is below the average and declining.
The unrealized is holding very high historically at 2.2M. but here again ahead of the promo we decided to increase it
by 1 point from 29 to 30

Our clients in general terms are long dollar, which weakened yesterday to 3 month low, as markets started to price in
possible rate cut as suggested by FED members during speeches yesterday.
