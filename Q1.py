Opening Slide: Introduction

Hello and welcome to the goal presentation on ensuring competitive trading conditions on Indices and Energies and
increasing profitability. I'll share with you the progress we made over the past quarter, the KRs we achieved, and our
path forward.

To achieve our main goal we focused on two key results: First was to increase volume compared to the 2023 quarterly
average and 2nd was to increase PnL from spreads after IBs commissions.

Slide 2: KR1

To achieve our objectives, we took several steps:
-We selected main indices, Brent and crude oil, increased the leverage on them from 1:50 on indices and from 1:100 on
energies to 1:200, and lowered the spreads on all platforms.
-communicate with clients and internal teams.
-And then monitored the client's activity and manually adjusted indices for dividends to prevent abuse.

Thanks to our efforts we achieved a significant uptick in volume across all symbols, with the highest increase on Nikkei
and S&P 500.
The total increase of the trading volume over the quarter was 26.99%, so above our target 22.5%

Slide 3: KR2

Increased volumes contributed positively to our PnL from spreads, despite having lower spreads than before. The overall
increase was 311k compared to the target of 302k. As for decomposition, the entire increase of PnL came from indices.
All 5 of them contributed positively to the overall result. Energies however contributed slightly negatively, as the
difference between average execution spread in this quarter and last year were too big to be offset by increase in volume.

Slide 4: Impact on Strategic goal

The impact on the strategic goal of increasing the overall profitability, is that we can expect on average an extra
300k quarterly from spreads on selected instruments, if current volume levels are sustained. Also, we haven't
noticed any negative impact on other trading classes.

Slide 5: Drivers, blockers

As for the drivers of growth
-the main driver were the better trading conditions that we provided on indices and energies, and hence becoming more
competitive compared to other brokers
-and also, promotional activities on Nasdaq at the beginning of the goal, and then on energies during Ramadan promo,
helped to increase the volumes

As for the blockers, we didn't have many:
-one worth mentioning was the absence of a dividend adjustment mechanism, and that we had to do it manually through the
quarter.

Slide 6: Learnings and Future Plans

The goal led us to some valuable insights, like the importance of adjusting our trading conditions to major competitors.

-Our total PnL, including not only profit from spreads but also from market movement increased by over 1M compared to 2023
quarterly average. The overall PnL is impacted by various things, like market volatility or client's positioning, and
is always hard to predict. But we think that the higher leverage we provided contributed positively, as it incentivises
clients to take more risks.
-Second thing we noticed is that the share of volume traded on symbols that we introduced new conditions on increased
from 1.46% to 1.84 % of overall volume traded on Octa, which is a 26% increase, but on minor indices and natgas that
traded on old conditions, the share in overall volume decreased by -27%. This proves, that the absolute increase of
volume, that we measured in KRs, wasn't just because of some external factors, but due to the introduction of new
conditions

Looking forward, we plan to:

Do some additional tests, on further decreasing of spreads on indices and how it will impact the PnL.
Explore the potential of increasing leverage on minor indices.
Implement an automated dividend adjustment mechanism.

Conclusion and Thank You

In conclusion, our initiatives have successfully enhanced trading conditions on Indices and Energies, leading to
increased volume and profitability. Both KRs were achieved. If you have any questions about the goal or the
presentation, please submit them and I will answer them on Tuesday. Thank you.
