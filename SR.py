Hello everyone, and thank you for joining. Let me tell you about what was the goal of adding new .Daily instruments and
what we were able to achieve.

[Slide 1]
Our main focus was to increase trading volume and revenue and diversify our offering with intraday instruments applying
the MVP approach. Daily instruments, in contrast to regular instruments, are forcibly closed 5 minutes before the
session ends, but offer higher leverage and better spreads in return. At the beginning we did a simulation of trading
volume and profit if regular instruments were closed at the end of the day, and based on the results of that simulation
we chose most traded stocks and indices. Then during the quarter we decided to also include main cryptocurrencies,
and energies.

[Slide 2]
As for KR metrics. At the moment we are at 5250 lots traded, and the target is 14000 by the end of the next week.
It constitutes about 37% of the goal, and if we continue at this pace we should arrive at around 6.5k - 7k lots,
which will be 50% of the target.

[Slide 3]
KR2 metric is PnL per lot, which currently stands at 13.6, which is 75% of the target 18.17.

[Slide 4]
The impact on the strategic goal, was to increased profits from Tier 1-2 regions with minimal losses in trade volume.
We were aiming at 254k in revenue, and for now we are at 71.4k (28%).

[Slide 5]
As for the drivers, the addition of cryptos and energies really helped us out. They made up about 81% of our volume,
even though they were only available for half of the Quarter, and some of them even less.

We did have some blockers. We couldn't add these new instruments to the website in spreads & conditions and live quotes
sections. The spreads were showing up wrong, they were same as regular instruments. But in fact they are lower. 
We decided not to show them with wrong spreads, to avoid confusing our clients.

We also had a delay in sending out notices about the new instruments because we added more than we initially planned
and had some translations delays in the meantime.

We didn't have enough time to add new .Daily instruments (cryptos, energies) to Cyber Monday Promo, as they were added
in the middle of quarter, and it was already too late for Marketing team to include them in the promo.

[Slide 6]

There's an observable positive trend in performance. Comparing recent sprints, the .Daily instruments have
shown very good growth. There's been a 139% increase in PnL, rising from $13,087 to $31,247, and an 83%
increase in lots traded, from 1,138 to 2,077. This progress indicates a strong upward momentum, although it suggests
that our initial targets may have been overly ambitious. Also, there is no swap abuse risk, with .Daily instruments,
as they are forcibly closed before session ends.

Looking ahead, we plan to increase the leverage for BTCUSD, ETHUSD and energy commodities. Currently, .Daily
instruments offer a 1:200 leverage, in contrast to the 1:100 leverage for regular instruments.
We believe adjusting this could provide an interesting incentive for our clients. Additionally, we are looking into
integrating these instruments to the OTR platform.

[Closing]

To wrap up, we didn't meet our goals, but the trajectory of .Daily instruments remains encouraging, and we anticipate
meeting our goals, albeit with some delay.
That will be all, any questions?"""
