In an attempt to forecast the clients PnL we took the daily data for our top3 symbols XAUUSD, EURUSD and
GBPUSD, and checked for above 2 standard deviation daily moves and their frequency. Then we extracted the dates when at
least one of these symbols had above the 2 st dev move.

After that we checked what were the economic news releases during this time and the top market headlines, the
majority of them involved Central Banks interest rates decisions and speeches, or there
were inflation and jobs data releases. Almost all of them were profitable days for us.

Since 2021 there were 52 days that met the criteria. We excluded the day when the war started, as it was by
far the biggest gain, and we wanted to focus on events that could happen regularly. So that left us with 51 days,
21 in 2021 and 28 in 2022 and 2 in 2023. Only 2 of those days were unprofitable for us and the max profit for clients
barely exceeded 400k. The avg gain was 4.3M, 3.7M realised for 2021 and 4.6M from 2022. If we didn't exclude 24th of
February, the average gain would be 4.9M since 2021. Also, these moves were responsible for approximately 25% of realised
profit during these two years.

Using this historical data we can conclude for now that, based on frequency of at least 2 st dev moves:
1. we can expect a market move that will result in client's realised losses of 4.3M on average twice per month
1a. as for 2021 statistically it was 3 moves every 2 months, averaging 3.7M
1b. as for 2022 and January and February this year statistically it was 2 moves every 1 month, averaging 4.6M

What is worth mentioning is that during the last 3 months we only had 3 days that met criteria, one in December and two
in February. And the average loss for clients was 4.3M. So just in line with the average value, but only once per month
as opposed to twice per month on average.

As for 2020, we had 61 days like this, 58 of them were profitable, and the average profit was almost 700k. However,
our figures for this period cannot be directly compared with current values, as the client's exposure at that time
was few times smaller.

We also checked for 2 st dev moves in prior years, dating back to 2016, and found out that on average they were
happening 37 times a year. So, our expectation of 2 moves per month is not exaggerated.

What we plan to do next, is to research the price trends of major instruments, and figure out how the clients are doing
when the markets are trending, and how do they fare when the markets are ranging, without clear trend in place.
This should give us the approximation on how often, and for how long we can expect the winning streaks for clients.

The difference between the two years, can be attributed to much lower volatility on markets in 2021 than 2022
