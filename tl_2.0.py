Slide 2: Agenda
Today, I will be discussing four central themes:

    'Assessing our Current Team Structure': Here we will delve into our current operational setup, and explore potential enhancements.
    'Addressing Scheduling Issues': I will identify existing issues with our rostering system and suggest ways to optimize it.
    'Improving Operational Efficiency': In this section, I'll propose strategies to refine our operational work.
    'Strategic Planning for the Long-Term': Lastly, I'll put forward a few forward-thinking proposals intended to enhance our strategic growth.

Slide 3: Current Team Structure
Our team comprises 11 dedicated operational dealers operating within a flat structure. However, there's been dissatisfaction concerning shift allocation due to this lack of distinction between roles. Notably, we have two experienced dealers - Dima and Vlad - who are slightly detached from this pattern, creating an imbalance.

Slide 4: Proposed Team Structure
I propose a hierarchical structure, akin to that in the IT sector, with defined roles including junior, mid, senior, expert, and potentially senior expert. This structure would bring more clarity to roles and responsibilities.

Slide 5: Role Descriptions
To provide more insight:

    Junior Dealer/Dealer: Primarily responsible for operational tasks, aiding in high-priority tasks, and handling low to mid-priority tasks.
    Senior Dealer: More project-oriented, leading high-priority tasks with less focus on operational work.
    Expert/(Senior Expert): Primarily project-based work.

Slide 6: Benefits of Progressing Up the Hierarchy
Being higher in the hierarchy does come with its perks. It offers flexibility in project selection, and there's no obligation to do extra tasks. There'll be more "white D" shifts, which are contingent on the position, task difficulty, and the workload required to finish extra projects. This structure should help in achieving a fair distribution of the coveted "white D" shifts.

Slide 7: Addressing Scheduling Challenges
There are ongoing issues with our scheduling, particularly with night shifts. To make them more attractive, we could consider benefits such as additional pay or extra days off. Also, allowing staff to express their preferences for shift timings and accommodating them wherever possible could further enhance job satisfaction.

Slide 8: Enhancements in Operational Workflow
To boost our operational efficiency, we need to:

    Reduce the number of withdrawals to approve
    Simplify the main briefing process
    Highlight crucial events in the Dealing Diary
    Clearly assign trading schedule responsibilities among teams
    Foster transparency in departmental goals

Slide 9: Withdrawals & Trading Schedule
We can work with the CTP department to establish new thresholds, particularly for smaller withdrawals. This would reduce unnecessary work. Furthermore, we need a clear division of trading schedule responsibilities between the operational and change teams to prevent miscommunication.

Slide 10: Dealerâ€™s Diary and Main Briefing
I suggest bookmarking topics in the Dealer's Diary for scheduled discussions, summarizing essential team meetings, and including a section for crucial events.

Slide 11: Enhancing Information Flow
We need to see the 'bigger picture' to understand our role within the company better. Keeping the team informed about ongoing processes, strategic initiatives, and major projects that impact our work will lead to improved efficiency.

Slide 12: Long-Term Strategic Plans
Strategically, we should consider removing shares from our offerings and introducing agricultural commodities, platinum, and palladium. Also, we need to conduct more research on competition, best execution practices, and market trends to enhance our product offerings.

Slide 13: Shares
Given the amount of work involved with shares and the minor profit they generate for the company, it might be beneficial to reconsider their place in our portfolio.

Slide 14: Pros and Cons of Removing Shares
Removing shares will reduce workload and server pressure. However, we must also consider the potential reputational risk.

Slide 15: Recommendations
We could either completely remove shares or retain the top-performing ones. This would strike a balance between reducing workload and mitigating reputational risk.

Slide 16: Potential Additions to Our Portfolio
We should consider adding popular commodities like Platinum and Palladium, as well as agricultural commodities which are currently in demand due to market conditions.

Slide 17: Keeping an Eye on the Competition
It's crucial to stay informed about our competitors' offerings and conditions. This would help us tailor our offerings and understand potential profit and target audience for each product.

Slide 18: Market Research
Lastly, we should monitor industry articles, social media, and market trends to anticipate future trading patterns and adjust our conditions and offerings accordingly. A proactive approach will enable us to mitigate issues, such as the FTX case, in a timely manner.
