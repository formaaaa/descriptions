Today, I want to share with you a research we conducted on the price trends of our top four major instruments -
EURUSD, GBPUSD, XAUUSD, and USDJPY, over the period from April 2015 to February 2023. Our objective was to understand
how our clients perform in trending markets, versus ranging markets, and how this affects our profitability.

(charts)
To begin with, we focused on short-term trends, highlighted here in green, identified using the Choppiness Index, which
is a volatility indicator that helps determine if the market was trading sideways or within a trend on historical data.

(main - summary)
We found that our top four instruments were trending on average 33% of the time, and that clients realized approximately
68% of our profits during these trending periods. The average duration of a trending phase was 22 days.

(seasonality - charts)
We also examined seasonality by analyzing the number of trending days in each month, and the average realized PnL during
these periods, excluding the day that the war started. We found that March, April, July, September,
and November were generally good months for us, while October and December tended to be challenging.

(top 4 - last 3 months)
Overall, our analysis showed that the last three months were unusual compared to historical data, with no trending
periods for three of the four instruments.

(DXY)
The reason for this could be the price action of the US dollar, which is either quoted or the base currency for all four
symbols. In the last three months, the US dollar has remained relatively stable, with no major short-term moves in any
direction. As a result, our realized PnL during the trending phase was just 16M compared to the average of 40M, and the
overall profit for this timeframe on top4 instruments was 31M compared to 60M on average.

In summary, our research indicates that our clients perform bad during trending periods and volatile sessions, as
discussed last week, and that our profitability is closely linked to the frequency and duration of these trends and
moves.

(realized - summary)
While the last three months have been atypical historically speaking, we anticipate that the period from March
to September will be more favorable in terms of profitability. We believe that seasonality and the reversion to the mean
for the number of trending and volatile days will be a positive factor going forward. Based on historical data for this
period we can estimate an average realized gain of 25M monthly. Thank you.
