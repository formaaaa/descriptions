I'm going to give you a quick run-through of what our Research and Analysis team is doing and the main areas of 
responsibility. And then me and Vlad will show you our current goals for this quarter and roadmaps.

Slide 1 - Main Goal
Our main task is to make sure we're making as much money as we can from clients trading. We do this by adjusting our 
spreads, depending on the market situation like volatility, upcoming news releases, and clients behavior.
We are working on diversifying and expanding our offer, and doing in depth research on our main competitors in various
regions and market analysis.

Slide 2 - Responsibilities
-We look at market trends, track changes in trading volume and volatility in different asset classes.
-Figure out what our competitors are doing, what conditions do they offer, how do we fare in comparison, are they
introducing any new asset classes or offering non-standard bonuses, investigate partnership programmes.
-Based on this research, we evaluate potential additions to our offer, by trying to measure potential demand and
profitability, costs of adding them, and risks involved.
-Then, most likely in 2Q, we will work on adding those new instruments to the offer, with the help of Change and AF teams
-We perform a correlation and cohorts analysis, to check how client's from different cohorts behave, and how does this
impact our trading metrics like PnL per lot and VPT
-We also participate in the quarterly planning process, where we establish the local goals, calculate the measurable
impacts, and then defend and execute them

Slide 3 - How We Work
-When it comes to local goals, we work in the sprint format. The goal is set for the entire quarter, and it's divided
into two-week sprints. For each sprint we have a KRs that we try to achieve, and then after each sprint we give a review
and outline our progress, main drivers and setbacks.
-We also work closely with other teams to make sure our strategies align in the bigger picture of what our company is
doing. This goes for changes in instruments specifications, promos etc

Slide 4 - Daily Routine
Involves checking recent news and market events, investigating our trading metrics, adjusting the
spreads, discussing our findings, analyzing data and collaborating with other departments. We also have regular syncs
about the progress of our tasks and goals, to make necessary adjustments if needed.

Slide 5 - Joining the Team
As for the requirements to join the team, you should have a strong understanding of financial markets, trading
instruments, and trading / investing in general. Be able to analyze and model the data, synthesise information and
draw conclusions from them, have a working knowledge of trading platforms, SQL and Python, necessary for getting and
computing the data.

Slide 6 - Summary
The role of the team is to make sure our offer is competitive, increase the profitability and volume traded. Risk
management, and collaboration with regional, marketing and education teams on cross departmental strategies

=====
My goal objective is to ensure competitive trading conditions on Indices and Energies and increase the company's
profitability
KR1 is to increase the volume by 22.5% compared to quarterly average from last year on selected instruments
KR2 is to Increase the total PnL after IB commission by 302k

WHAT WAS ALREADY DONE
To walk you through the process. Initially we did a competition analysis for all our instruments in top 10 GEOs, and
identified indices and energies as the asset classes that we lag behind in leverage provided and spreads. Then we
selected the following instruments to amend conditions on.

ROADMAP
The roadmap for the goal is as follows
IN THE 2nd SPRINT
-we made a final decision regarding the new trading conditions
The plan is to increase the leverage to 200, from 50 on indices, and 100 for energies, and reduce spreads for NAS100 -2,
SPX500 -5, US30 -10, XBRUSD -1, XTIUSD -1. We prepare notifications for clients, and we started working on dividend
adjustment for Indices with Change Team.

IN THE 3rd SPRINT
We want to implement the dividend adjustment for indices, apply changes in leverage and spreads for regular
instruments and their .Daily equivalents, for them not to lose their competitive advantage. We will also have a promo
for Nasdaq, where we will decrease spreads by -15%. And we need to come up with metrics how to track the results

IN THE SUBSEQUENT SPRINTS
In subsequent sprints we will manually analyze them, and adjust our trading conditions as needed, this includes
adjusting trading conditions on currently selected instruments, and also possibly adding new ones, and also keep track
of swap abusers.

RISKS
as for the risks, we outlined three main risks:
-Increased exposure due to higher leverages, that needs to be monitored
-Increased risk of swap abuse due to higher leverage, in here we will work with AF team to implement their workflow to
catch early potential abusers
-That for now we are lacking a dividend adjustment mechanism, which will be developed with Change Team during the goal

QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS
As for the Questions and concerns, we need to investigate whether the anticipated increased volume on indices and
energies, is taking share from our other TOP20 symbols, and what is the profitability of the new volume in contrast to
volume on TOP20, not to switch clients to less profitable instruments
