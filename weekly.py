"""
1. Last week we were testing a trading bot to gather information on execution on competitors.
This week we will deposit accounts, and start testing on 0.01 lot size, if all goes well we will move up to 1 lot.

2. We did some approximations regarding additional PnL increases we can expect from additional news delta extensions,
on top4 majors and top4 cryptos, and it looks like we can get additional 0.5m a quarter.

3. We have a new monthly task, to investigate major differences in PnL per lot for different GEOs. We did the 1st one
manually, and now working on automatizing it.

4. And we started research about potentially onboarding new LPs that can give us regional instruments, like Asian
indices, Indian stocks and also new commodities.
