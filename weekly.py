"""
1. Last week we were building and testing our trading bot on competitors demo account.
This week we will deposit real accounts, and already start gathering data
we'll start from 0.01 lot size, if all goes well we will move up to bigger positions.

(2. We did some approximations how increasing our spreads on news just by 10% would impact our PnL,
on top4 majors and top4 cryptos, and it looks like we could get additional 0.5m a quarter.
We will present the final proposal for extensions, after they are done with testing, and have all the necessary data.)

3. We also started working on a new task, to investigate out of the ordinary monthly differences in PnL for
different countries.
We did the 1st one manually, and now working on automatizing it.

4. And we started research about potentially onboarding new LPs that can give us regional instruments, like Asian
indices, Indian stocks and also new commodities. And will be collaborating on this with CY dealers.
