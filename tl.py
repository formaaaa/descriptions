Slide 2: Agenda
I have divided my presentation into 4 main topics
1. Team structure where I will discuss our current structure, and my ideas on how to change it
2. Schedule - where I will discuss current issues with our scheduke and plans how to improve it
3. Operational work - where I will discuss ideas on how to improve our operational work
4. Strategic plans - and finally ideas on how to tackle some strategic longer term plans

Slide 3: Current team structure
Our current team consists of 11 operational dealers, the structure is flat, meaning we no matter your skills or
experience, everybody is doing the same job / the same shifts, except two lets say expert dealers -
Dima and Vlad
This causes some dissatisfaction over the shift allocation, there are no clear distinctions between positions

Slide 4: Proposed Team Structure
I propose to have a structure that resembles the IT world: junior, mid, senior, expert and potentially senior expert
roles.

Slide 5: Role descriptions
Junior Dealer / Dealer – more focused on operational tasks, low to mid-priority tasks, assisting in higher priority
tasks
Senior Dealer – more project-based approach, lead in mid to high priority tasks, less focused on operational tasks
Expert / (Senior Expert) – project-based work

Slide 6: Benefits on being higher in hierarchy
Number of “white D” shifts dependent on the position and the number, difficulty and amount of workload needed to finish
the additional projects
More interesting work, some flexibility in proposing and choosing the projects to be involved in
But there will be no obligation to do extra tasks, meaning that if a team member is a Senior, but he feels he excels
best doing operational work he will be under no obligation on participating in many additional tasks. Same for Junior
and mid level dealers, if they still lack experience and knowledge, but want to participate in tasks from backlog,
they can do it and will get more white D shifts than they would normally get.
I think this should balance off the allocation of most desired white D shifts. Right now it doesn't matter whether you
are loaded with projects, or not, you get aproximately the same amount. This causes situations that one person has a lot of
tasks, but they need to do operational work, and at the same time somebody with white D shift is approving WDs because
they have nothing to do outside the operational stuff.

Slide 7: Schedule and challenges it poses
As we know the big issue with the schedule are the night shifts. If we could think of something that would make them
more desirable. The obvious idea is money. I know that some companies offer additional pay for the night shifts.
If we could introduce this, that could make them more attractive. The other solution would to have an additional day off
from the calendar after working one week of night shift.
Another idea about the schedule is to ask each team member about they favourite shifts (duty, subduty, 10am subduty,
evening, weekends). Different peaople have different preferences. I see no issue somebody working all the weekends, or
double the amount of evening shifts if they want to.

Slide 8: Operational workflow improvements
Decrease the amount of WDs to approve
Shorten the main briefing
Highlight most important events in the Dealing Diary
Bookmark suggested topics to discuss so we can schedule a date to discuss it
Clearly divide trading schedule responsibilities between operational and change teams
More transparency and exchange of information about departmental goals

Slide 9: Withdrawals & trading schedule
Produce some new thresholds with the CTP department, not to waste time on small withdrawals, that shouldn’t be in the
dealing-fd channel in the first place, like for example WDs below $100. This would save us some unnecessary work and
allow to focus more on other tasks.
Clearly divide trading schedule responsibilities between operational team and change team, in a way that there are no
misunderstandings about who is responsible for what part. That way we avoid disagreements between teams, that escalated
recently.

Slide 10: Dealer’s Diary and Main briefing
Bookmark suggested topics in Dealer’s Diary so we can schedule a date to discuss it when all necessary team members are
connected
Add new section to Dealer’s Diary, for most important changes / events that happened
Create a short summary after every important team meeting, for everybody who

Slide 11: Flow of information
I feel that as an operational team, we do a lot of manual work, without seeing the bigger picture. Some of the tasks,
especially the spread changes take a lot of time, it's easy to make a mistake and we have been hearing about the
automatization for a long time. Without seeing the bigger picture these changes might seem completely useless, as we
do not know how this impact the bottom line of the company. I suggest to keep our team posted about main ongoing
Antifraud and Change teams processes, strategic processes, quarterly sprint goals and any major projects that will
impact our team work. I realise that everybody can participate in spritns as a passive observer, but rarely anybody
dose that in practise. It takes some time from the day, when we are in the middle of our daily assignements, as well
as due to rotational work not everybody is in the office taht day. I feel that having a bigger picture overviwe, at
leats some of the team members would have a better understanding of our role within the scope of the whole company.

Slide 12: Strategic plans
Remove shares from the offer, add agriculture, platinum and palladium instead
More research on competition, their conditions, products that we can add to the offer
Add monitoring of best execution, slippage, execution time
More work with the market, monitoring industry articles, social media, looking for trends in the markets, predicting which instruments/asset classes may be traded more soon

Slide 13: Shares
The YTD volume on shares was approximately 2000 lots
The YTD result was approx. 6k profit for the company
The amount of work that we need to put in – monitoring holidays, making notifications, news for the site, mailings,
watching for earnings, putting shares to close only mode is far greater that the added value of having these symbols in
offer

Slide 14: Pros and cons of removing shares
Pros:
We reduce the amount of workload for operational and change team
We are less prone to making some ommissions when it comes to trading schedule
Less pressure for the servers
Cons:
Reputational risk

Slide 15: Suggestions
We can either remove the shares completely, or if we do not want to risk reputational risks, we can keep the top20
shares (AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, TSLA etc)
The 2nd approach would be preferred in my opinion, as we will reduce the workload a lot, without risking too much
reputational risk, and we can see whether this would impact our bottom line (volume, profit)

SLide 16: Symbols to add
We are missing some crucial instruments in our offer like precious metals: Platinum and Palladium, and agriculture
From my experience, both as a dealer and a trader, Platinum and Palladium are very popular amongst speculators, given
that they are in the same basket as gold and silver, but platinum has a higher beta than gold, and palladium is less
correlated with the rest of the precious metals
Agriculture on the other hand is a very hot market segment, especially in the inflationary / stagflationary market
regime that we are in now

SLide 17: Competition research
Regularly research the competitors, their offer, conditions, instruments and products that they have in offer
Research products that can be added to the offer, their target audience, and potential PnL:
Passive longer-term products (macro strategies, shares/ETF baskets, theme strategies)
actively managed products

SLide 18: Market research
As dealers we do very little work with market events, apart from the economic calendar. This part addresses the often
brought up issue about lack of learning about the markets. Also, when we look back at the FTX case, if we discussed
more the current events and developments int the markets, we might have spotted it earlier and take appropriate actions.
So, my suggestiosn are as follows:
Monitoring industry articles and social media
Looking for developing trends in the markets
Identifying market phases
Predicting which instruments / asset classes may gain popularity
Adjusting trading conditions and offer accordingly
