/17.00 Yesterday evening we had a MT4 Real9 self reboot, the downtime was 1 min
/23.00 in the blackout we restarted the MT5 Main1 Backup server, because we added aggregator feeder

/RPnL: The day finished with 1.3M in our favour
====================
/2.00: During the night shift, nothing happened
/6.00 at 6AM this morning we had a major gain of 1M, mainly due to one master, he closed a few large unprofitable
trades on GOLD, and he has over 300 copiers
/8.00: * reports were done
       *
/10.00:We had no quotes for LSE, XE, EPA and EAS stocks from Exante for the period 10.00 - 10.30. XE, EAS and EPA stocks
switched to Capital, but we don't have a secondary provider for LSE shares, so we put them to close only.  As it turned
out we were receiving delayed quotes for these symbols by 30m. At first, we were misinformed by their support, that we
need additional subscription for these feeds. After that they fixed it, and promised to revert back on Monday with more
details why this happened.
We checked trades for these stocks during this period, no major volumes were opened/closed.




/RPnL: the realized result as of right now is ....
the top losing symbols for us are:  ....
and the top profitable ones are:  .....


/UPnL:
