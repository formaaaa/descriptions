Today, I will walk you through the onboarding roadmap for new members of our R&A team for the year 2024.
This roadmap is designed to ensure a smooth and comprehensive onboarding experience, focusing on key skills and
milestones each quarter. Let's dive into each quarter's objectives, key metrics, and actions.

Q3 Overview

Expected Result:
In Q3, we aim to develop an overall vision of our team processes. New members should understand how different
product features relate to and affect each other. Additionally, they will participate in at least three R&A tasks
or projects with guidance and mentorship from the team.

Key Metrics (KR):

    KR1: Completion of assigned tasks/projects will be tracked. The goal is a simple Yes or No on whether the tasks
    were completed.
    KR2: The newcomer should be able to handle routine processes independently, indicating readiness to delegate these
    tasks.

Actions:

    Discovery Projects: New members will engage in discovery projects to get hands-on experience.
    SQL Utilization: They will work with SQL to complete tasks, which is essential for our data-driven decision-making.
    Data Analysis: Analyzing data to draw meaningful conclusions will be a key focus.
    Feedback Sessions: We will have feedback and correction meetings as needed to ensure continuous improvement.

Q4 Overview

Expected Result:
By the end of Q4, new members should be able to propose and justify changes to trading conditions using our R&A tools.
They should also be capable of calculating and suggesting improvements for Octa Promos, including spreads, leverage.
Additionally, they should be able to explain profit considerations, such as symbol/assets classes and
seasonality.

Key Metrics (KR):

    KR1: At least one trading conditions change proposal should be verified and approved by the R&A team.
    KR2: At least one promo proposal should also be verified and approved by the R&A team.

Actions:

    Reading R&A Reports: New members will learn to read and draw conclusions from R&A reports.
    Using the Promo Calculator: They will use the promo calculator for dynamic analysis of symbols and assets classes.
    Feedback Sessions: Feedback and correction meetings will be held if necessary to guide improvements.

Q1 Overview

Expected Result:
In Q1 of the following year, the focus will be on understanding the relation and cross-impact of our main business
metrics. New members should keep up with competitors by understanding our conditions compared to theirs. They will also
complete complex projects with minimal supervision, such as adding new symbols to our system.

Key Metrics (KR):

    KR: The key metric for Q1 is the completion of a complex task or project, showcasing the new member's ability to
     work independently.

Actions:

    Business Metrics Analysis: New members will perform basic analyses of our company using key business metrics.
    Hypothesis Definition: They will define and test their own hypotheses to contribute to our strategic decision-making.
    Feedback Sessions: Continuous feedback and correction meetings will be conducted as needed to support their growth.

developing specific skills and knowledge areas, with regular feedback sessions to foster continuous improvement.
