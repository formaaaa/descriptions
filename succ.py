In Q1 of the following year, the focus will be on understanding the relation and cross-impact of our main business
metrics (like PF, Unr PnL, PnL/Lot, VPT, overall PnL and the decomposition of it, Clean PnL).
New members should be able to keep up with competitors by understanding our conditions compared to theirs, and also be
aware of their offerings, like promos, new symbols / products they are adding.
They will also complete complex projects with minimal supervision, such as adding new symbols to our system.

     work independently.

Actions:

    Business Metrics Analysis: New members will perform basic analyses of our company's key business metrics.
    Hypothesis Definition: They will try to define and test their own hypotheses to contribute to our quarterly goal
    planning - and a note here, we decided that this is more like a nice to have, not obligatory, but will basically
    show readiness to join the team.
