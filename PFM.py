To give you a brief overview about the project we are working on:
- it will be a passive investment strategy, where we will be managing clients money as an options' portfolio
- the idea is to trade off our client's exposure, by identifying moments in markets that they get bet overly heavy on
the price increase or decline, and then trade the other way, using the statistics that 70 - 80% of them lose money
- we already back-tested those strategies, they give really good results, and in Q3 we want to test them on real money
- if this front test will be successful, we want to be ready by the end of quarter to start working on implementing it

That's why we need to know in advance how we can manage the money flow from offshore client's deposits to our Saxo
account that is opened for CySec broker. We asked George, but he needs more info from us like which bank accounts we
will use, from which jurisdictions the money will be sent etc
