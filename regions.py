"""As I briefly described in the messages we are looking now to do a regional analysis of our market presence and
refine our product offerings in different regions, like adjusting spreads, leverages and adding new instruments
We would like to have a clear understanding of our strategic position in various regions.

1. Setting the Context:

We are looking to prioritize regions and countries for our trading conditions analysis, based on factors like
market demand, competition, and client preferences. Our goal is to maximize profit while effectively managing risk."

2. Prioritizing Regions and Countries:

"Let's start with our regional focus. Based on current data and market analysis, which regions and countries should we
prioritize to maximize PnL? Can you share insights on market size, growth potential, and our current market share in
these regions?"

3. Understanding Competitors:

"Moving on to our competition, who are our biggest competitors in these prioritized regions? What strategies are they
employing, and how are they positioned in terms of market share and client base?"

4. Instrument Classes and Trading Preferences:

"Next, Iâ€™d like to discuss the instrument classes. Which instruments are currently most popular among clients in our
target regions? Additionally, what insights do we have about the trading preferences of these clients?"

5. Identifying Market Trends:

"Turning our attention to market trends, what are the emerging trends in these different regions? Are there any
anticipated shifts in market dynamics that we should be preparing for?"

6. Assessing Our Product Offerings:

"And in terms of our product offerings, do we have gaps in our current portfolio? Are there instruments that
are in demand but missing from our offer?"""
